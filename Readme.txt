Thanks for giving me this wonderful opportunity for having my hands on this task. I did not know any knowledge of Next Js or tailwind css, But I gained many new stuff regarding Next JS and tailwind. This component that I was asked to made is fully customizable. I used the props to pass the image, title, total events, and sports for the card component.
It was a really nice project for me to learn Next js.
As for the usabiility steps:

=> To change the image, title, Total Events, or sports you simply have to pass them in the index.js file inside the card component.
Once again thanks.
